# Marking

At undergraduate level, we are concerned with technical understanding and a rigorous way of reporting it.

At post graduate levels there will be more emphasis placed on synthesis and analysis which should be obvious from the conclusions. The conclusions will be heavily weighted, and the lecturer will be looking for signs that the student can analyze and evaluate the results of the laboratory work and can combine the knowledge gained from lectures and independent learning. The conclusions should reference credible material from independent study.

Check in each case before you commence work, as there may be some variation, but marking is typically:

* Description (5%)
* Aims (5%)
* Method (10%)
* Results (10%)
* Conclusion (70%)

Regardless of the level, lab books should be professional and well presented. No marks will be awarded for good presentation, this is expected. However, marks will be deducted for poor presentation, grammar, or spelling.

Screen shots and images should never be presented in isolation (e.g., without text) and should only be used where they contribute to the information presented. All such images should be labelled with a figure number and description.
